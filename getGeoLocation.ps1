#Use ipinfo.io service to get NAT IP Address as well as Geolocation data
#You will need a subscription to use this in a Company -> http://ipinfo.io
#ipinfo.io APIToken
$APIToken = '98734134kjh'

#Ensure Internet Explorer first launch is disabled
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main" -Name "DisableFirstRunCustomize" -Value 2

#Get NAT IP Address
$devicenatip = (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://ipinfo.io/ip').Content

#Get GeoLocation Data
$endpoint = "http://ipinfo.io/$devicenatip"+"?token="+"$APIToken"
$devicegeodata = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $endpoint
$devicegeoCountry = $devicegeodata.Country
$devicegeoRegion = $devicegeodata.Region
$devicegeoCity = $devicegeodata.City

#Return what you want - Country, Region or City
#Refer to https://www.geonames.org/countries/ for $devicegeoCountry codes.
#Return value should be used to find in WS1 Intelligence Automation and Tag a device. 
#The Tag would be a filter in a SmartGroup which is used to assign a Profile/Application.
#Example to return proper Country names rather than shortnames
if ($devicegeoCountry -eq "AU") {return "Australia"}
elseif ($devicegeoCountry -eq "US") {return "United States"}
elseif ($devicegeoCountry -eq "IN") {return "India"}

#return $devicegeoRegion

#return $devicegeoCity
